Creating a documentation for things i have learnt while making this:
models.py
we make three models for:
1.Profile-user
         -image
         -bio
         -facebook
         -instagram
         -linkedin
2.BlogPost-title
          -author
          -slug
          -image
          -datetime
3.Comment-user
         -content
         -blog
         -parent
         -dateTime

-Adding login and register


Steps to make a login view
1.if method=='POST' open try except block
2.get username and password and user_obj= filter the User model to check whether username exists
3.if not user_obj.exists():- message.error and redirect
4.user_obj authenticate username and password
5.if (user_obj) login(username,password) and redirect else error and redirect

Steps to make register views
1.if method=='POST' open try except block
2.get username and password and user_obj= filter the User model to check whether username exists
3. if user_obj.exists(): username already exists redirects
4.user_obj=User.objects.create(username=username)
user_obj.set_password(password)
user_obj.save()
redirect()
